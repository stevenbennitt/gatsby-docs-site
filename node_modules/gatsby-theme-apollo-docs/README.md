### versions

If omitted, only one version of docs will be built, based on the state of HEAD in the theme consumer repository. This is helpful for creating deploy previews for docs pages.

If used, the `versions` option expects an array of objects. Each object requires a `value` and `ref` property, and an optional `default` property. The `value` is what will show up in the version dropdown, and the `ref` should be a commit SHA, branch name. For the default branch, `HEAD` is probably the best `ref` to use.

```js
versions: [
  {
    value: '2.4',
    ref: 'origin/version-2.4'
  },
  {
    value: '2.5',
    ref: 'HEAD',
    default: true
  }
]
```

### sidebarCategories

The `sidebarCategories` option is an object keyed by category titles. Each entry in the object is an array of page paths. The path should resemble the location of a markdown file in the git repository, relative to the directory specified by the `contentDir` theme option, and without the _.md_ extension. Sidebar navigation items that are **not** a member of a category live under the `null` key.

```js
{
  null: [
    'index',
    'getting-started',
    'whats-new'
  ],
  Features: [
    'features/mocking',
    'features/errors',
    'features/data-sources'
  ]
}
```

## Creating pages

Create markdown files in your `contentDir` (typically _source_) to generate pages. Your markdown files should contain some frontmatter defining their titles and descriptions.

```markdown
---
title: Introduction
description: What is Apollo Server and what does it do?
---

Apollo Server is the best way to quickly build a production-ready, self-documenting API for GraphQL clients, using data from any source.
```

Page URLs will be derived from the file paths of your markdown. You can nest markdown files within directories to create pages with additional path segments.

## Older versions

This theme uses [`simple-git`](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js) to look for older versions of documentation and create pages for them. If no _gatsby-config.js_ is found in the docs directory of an older version, its existing Hexo config will be used to configure its `sidebarCategories`. Only one set of documentation will be generated per major version, based on its latest published tag.

## Deployment

All docs sites will eventually be deployed into a subdirectory, as configured by the `basePath` option&mdash;https://apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server, for example. [Read this guide](https://github.com/apollographql/gatsby-theme-apollo#deploying-to-a-subdirectory) to learn how to pull this off.

## Migration

To move one of our old Hexo-based sites to Gatsby using this theme, you can follow these steps:

### 1. Clean house

First, clone the repo and move into the _docs_ directory (`cd docs`). Delete that directory's _package-lock.json_ file and *node_modules* directory, and edit the _package.json_ file to look like this:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "gatsby develop --prefix-paths"
  }
}
```

Change the name of the _public_ directory (this typically contains the *_redirects* Netlify file) to _static_.

```bash
mv public static
```

You'll also need to edit the _docs_ directory's _.gitignore_ to reflect this change. You'll want to ignore the entire _public_ directory, as well as the _.cache_ directory. These changes will typically look like this:

```
  public/*
- !public/_redirects
+ .cache
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
$ npm install gatsby gatsby-theme-apollo-docs
```

That was easy!

### 3. Port _config.yml to gatsby-config.js

All of this theme's [configuration options](#configuration) are represented in existing Hexo *_config.yml* files. Moving them over is just a matter of copying and pasting, modifying some property names, and changing snake_case names to camelCase ones. In addition, you must add a `root` option and set it to `__dirname`. For example, here's a before/after of the iOS docs configs:

*_config.yml*

```yaml
title: Apollo iOS Guide # called `subtitle` in gatsby-config.js
subtitle: Apollo iOS Guide # not needed
description: A guide to using Apollo with iOS
versions:
  - '1' # if there's only one version, you don't need to port this option
sidebar_categories:
  null:
    - index
    - installation
    - api-reference
  Usage:
    - downloading-schema
    - initialization
    - fetching-queries
    - fragments
    - watching-queries
    - mutations
github_repo: apollographql/apollo-ios
root: /docs/ios/ # called `basePath` in gatsby-config.js
content_root: docs/source # called `contentDir` in gatsby-config.js
url: https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/ # not needed
public_dir: public/docs/ios # not needed
```

_gatsby-config.js_

```js
module.exports = {
  __experimentalThemes: [
    {
      resolve: 'gatsby-theme-apollo-docs',
      options: {
        root: __dirname, // <-- this is the only new property added
        subtitle: 'Apollo iOS Guide',
        description: 'A guide to using Apollo with iOS',
        contentDir: 'docs/source',
        basePath: '/docs/ios',
        githubRepo: 'apollographql/apollo-ios',
        sidebarCategories: {
          null: [
            'index',
            'installation',
            'api-reference'
          ],
          Usage:[
            'downloading-schema',
            'initialization',
            'fetching-queries',
            'fragments',
            'watching-queries',
            'mutations',
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
};
```

### 4. Add a Netlify config

Add a _netlify.toml_ file to the repo root. It should contain `base`, `publish`, and `command` properties. The `base` and `publish` properties should always be `docs/` and `docs/public/`, respectively. The `command` property will build the site using the `gatsby build` command, and then move the built website into the appropriate directory to be served using Fly.io. You should edit the directory names in that property to reflect the `basePath` option that you provided in your _gatsby-config.js_ file. Here's an example of the iOS docs Netlify config:

```toml
[build]
  base    = "docs/"
  publish = "docs/public/"
  command = "gatsby build --prefix-paths && mkdir -p docs/ios && mv public/* docs/ios && mv docs public/ && mv public/docs/ios/_redirects public"
[build.environment]
  NPM_VERSION = "6"
```

### 5. Deploy

When these changes are pushed to GitHub and a pull request is opened, Netlify will build a deploy preview so you can check out the changes made. When you open the deploy preview in your web browser, be sure to append the `basePath` to the URL. In the example of the iOS docs, the URL would look like this: https://deploy-preview-471--apollo-ios-docs.netlify.com/docs/ios
